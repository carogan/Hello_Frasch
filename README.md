## HelloFresh Pitch

- Hook: Health is complicated, its difficult but its paramount
- We set out to not only improve the UX but to improve you, the user, in the process and help you lead a healthy and happy live
- How do we achieve that: As mentioned watching your nutrition is important but tedious -> who knows where to get Vitamin K from?
- products like Hello Fresh are here to help you with the tedious task of feeding yourself and we want to build on them tackle nutrition at its core
- Micro nutrients
- Some examples what vitamin K and B9 are useful for
- Go into Live demo:
- Hello Fresh already lets you filter for allergies and preferences in a manual way, can lead to deficiencx
- recommendations based on History, Season and Current Nutritional Needs
- If activate Nutrition Manager you can track the impact of meal choices on you micro nutrient levels
- Values are parsed from US Department of Agriculture -> legit bro
- Scale Up Potential
- Inferral of dietary preferences based on what meals are declined->based on that a recommended substitution those ingredients to maintain balanced micro nutrient levels
- Started development, but based on limited recipes currently available the resulting suggestions were pretty non-traditional
  
- Thank you for you attention we were
